Growing up in a technology-driven digital and surround by smart applications. As a designer I can't help but imagine how a design can be interacted to people while using coding and apprehend with visual arts
Also I belive that design something meaningful requires spending time on meticulous process and strive for the best way of interpretation in my design
Knowing that virtual reality will become significantly and raise among in new media platforms, I continue studying at The New School to achive a BFA in Technology and Design

### Immerse yourself as a user

- Trying to imagine me into the context of other people, with their history, values, and perception. From there, I design from a user's perspective.

### Core problem

- Always find the core problem first such as an idea, context, large picture, critical points. Then find the solution before start designing.

### Less is more

- My design aesthetic used to be maximalist, grunge and surreal. The more I learn about behavior and user's interaction, the more I realize simplicity is better for functional in UX.
