<h1>Pfizer Vaccine Approved for Emergency Use</h1>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized Pfizer/BioNTech’s application for emergency use of their COVID-19 vaccine. In anticipation of this, the NYC Health Department is preparing for vaccine distribution to hospitals the week of December 14 and to long-term care facilities the week of December 21.
    Health care workers who are at high-risk for exposure to COVID-19 will be prioritized to receive immediate vaccinations. Hospitals that receive the initial distribution of vaccine will vaccinate their staff.
    The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been shown to have 95% efficacy at preventing symptoms and decreasing severe COVID-19 infection.</p>

<h1>Moderna Vaccine</h1>
<p>The vaccine from Moderna, which has not yet been authorized by the FDA, has also shown in its trial to have about 95% efficacy in preventing symptoms and decreasing severity of symptoms of COVID-19. The FDA is reviewing this vaccine for emergency authorization the week of December 14.

    The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines both work by teaching the body to create an immune response for a virus that is not present in the body. No serious safety concerns have been found for either vaccine. Each vaccine has shown minor-to-moderate side effects, such as injection site pain, fatigue and headache.
    
    The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines will each require two doses, through shots in the arm, three or four weeks apart.</p>
