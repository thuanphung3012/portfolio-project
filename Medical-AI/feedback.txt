MC: Some form of intelligence with emotional capacity might be interesting for intake into medical systems; perhaps the entry point into the larger system. If you were to continue this project, it would be good to speak to a medical design researcher about issues with intake

I think this is a really strong concept considering a lot of medical practices are shifting to telemedicine, I definitely see AI being the next step in urgent care. Your chat bot looks pretty well developed (using keywords im guessing?) and i’m excited to see the next iteration. I think the design is really clean but it needs a bit more color for the interface to be more inviting and usable - arielle 

^ Would love to see this paired with a physical manifestation of the AI..its a great opportunity to expand medical assitances…

Where is the text on your homepage from? It sounds very "sci-fi" and doesn't sound like what a medical service would say to you. "Express and witness"

Chatbot feature is really small - can't see what you're typing. Try looking at how Quartz previous Messenger was designed: the input isn't freeform text, its more like a multiple choice: https://www.adweek.com/digital/quartzs-new-chatbot-is-bringing-conversational-news-to-facebook-messenger/. At the same time, it's SO easy to misdiagnose people and group their symptoms into buckets that aren't very productive.

For the presentation, spend time showing your prototype more than giving the long written description, because your prototype will feature a lot of that already.
